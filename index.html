				<p id="Briefing">Archaeology is the study of human activity in the past, primarily through the recovery and analysis of the material culture and environmental data that they have left behind, which includes artifacts, architecture, biofacts (also known as eco-facts) and cultural landscapes (the archaeological record). Because archaeology employs a wide range of different procedures, it can be considered to be both a social science and a humanity,and in the United States it is thought of as a branch of anthropology,although in Europe it is viewed as a separate discipline.

                Archaeology studies human prehistory and history from the development of the first stone tools in eastern Africa 4 million years ago up until recent decades(Archaeology does not include the discipline of paleontology.) It is of most importance for learning about prehistoric societies, when there are no written records for historians to study, making up over 99% of total human history, from the Paleolithic until the advent of literacy in any given society. Archaeology has various goals, which range from studying human evolution to cultural evolution and understanding culture history.
                Archaeology developed out of antiquarianism in Europe during the 19th century, and has since become a discipline practiced across the world. Since its early development, various specific sub-disciplines of archaeology have developed, including maritime archaeology, feminist archaeology and archaeoastronomy, and numerous different scientific techniques have been developed to aid archaeological investigation. Nonetheless, today, archaeologists face many problems, such as dealing with pseudoarchaeology, the looting of artifacts, a lack of public interest, and opposition to the excavation of human remains. </p>

				<h2 id="heading"> Archaeological Practice in Bangladesh </h2>
			    
				<p id="Briefing">The practice of archaeology in Bangladesh began during the British period. Starting off as the Archaeological Survey of India in 1861, the present Archaeological Department under the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, Bangladesh, has been exploring, conserving and displaying archaeological sites in the country. At present the department looks after 448 heritage sites all over the country out of which two — Historic Mosque city of Bagerhat in Bagerhat district and ruins of the Buddhist vihara at Paharpur in Naogaon district— have been recognised as World Cultural Heritage Sites. History of the sites and the relics discovered are being displayed in about 16 museums run by the department.
				Sir Alexander cunningham's archaeological expeditions in areas now forming Bangladesh was carried out in 1879-80 and included Mahasthan and Paharpur. Cunningham also reported on bhasu vihara (Bhasu Vihara) near Mahasthan, Jogi Gupha near Paharpur, Ghatnagar, and Debar Dighi. Some other British administrators like EV Westmacott (1875), H Beveridge (1878), and CJ O'Donnel had already written on the ruins of Paharpur and Mahasthangarh. Owing to non-cooperation of the local zamindar, Cunningham could not investigate the site long enough to understand the real nature of Paharpur. Excavations carried out much later, however, proved that it was the remains of the biggest Buddhist monastery in the subcontinent (very recently Vikramashila has been claimed to be slightly larger).

				However the outstanding achievement of Cunningham during his 1879-80 tour was his brilliant identification of Mahasthangarh with the city of pundranagar on the basis of huen-tsang's itinerary. At a later date (1931), a stone plaque discovered from the site, bearing an inscription in early Brahmi characters (mahasthan brahmi inscription), points to the site's probable association with the Mauryan empire, perhaps as a provincial capital.

				<p id="Briefing">Initial excavations at these sites, particularly Paharpur and Mahasthan, were begun by some private research bodies, the foremost being the varendra research society of Rajshahi.</p>

								<p id="Briefing">Among the first sites to undergo archeological excavation were Stonehenge and other megalithic monuments in England. The first known excavations made at Stonehenge were conducted by Dr William Harvey and Gilbert North in the early 17th century. Both Inigo Jones and the Duke of Buckingham also dug there shortly afterwards. John Aubrey was a pioneer archaeologist who recorded numerous megalithic and other field monuments in southern England. He also discovered and mapped the Avebury henge monument. He wrote Monumenta Britannica in the late 17th century, as a survey of early urban and military sites, including Roman towns, "camps" (hillforts), and castles and a review of archaeological remains, including sepulchral monuments, roads, coins and urns. He was also ahead of his time in the analysis of his findings. He attempted to chart the chronological stylistic evolution of handwriting, medieval architecture, costume, and shield-shapes.

								William Stukeley was another antiquarian who contributed to the early development of archaeology in the early 18th century. He also investigated the prehistoric monuments of Stonehenge and Avebury; work for which he has been remembered as "probably... the most important of the early forerunners of the discipline of archaeology".He was one of the first to attempt to date the megaliths, and argued that they were a remnant of the pre-Roman druidic religion.</p>
								
								<p id="Briefing">Excavations were carried out in the ancient towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, both of which had been covered by ashes during the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. These excavations began in 1748 in Pompeii, while in Herculaneum they began in 1738 under the auspices of King Charles III of Naples. In Herculaneum, the Theatre, the Basilica and the Villa of the Papyri were discovered in 1768. The discovery of entire towns, complete with utensils and even human shapes, as well the unearthing of ancient frescos, had a big impact throughout Europe.</p>
